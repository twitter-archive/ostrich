4.8.2
-----
Changes:

- supports configuration which StatsCollection to report for a given AdminHttpService


4.8.0
-----
release: 8 August 2011

- Histogram improvements (used for percentiles)
    Use 3x more buckets
    getPercentile/minimum/maximum now returns midpoint of bucket, not
     upper boundary
    With the above two changes, getPercentile/minimum/maximum return
      an estimated value within 5% of the actual value.  Before, the

4.7.0

- Remove unnecessary synchronizations

- Upgrade to util-1.10


4.6.0
-----
release: 7 July 2011

- Use latched StatsListeners by default, so multiple listeners on the same
  time frequency get the same deltas.


4.5.2
-----
release: 6 July 2011

- Let the admin HTTP port be defined/overridden by the command line.

- Fix timeFuture* API to return positive values.

  loading a config.

- Fixed admin port "/" path, and added an "X-Ostrich-Version" header to all
  responses.


4.4.0
-----
release: 14 June 2011

- StatsListener computes distributions as deltas just like it does for
  counters.

- Distribution is now just a thin immutable wrapper around a Histogram, and
  FanoutMetric now has the same behavior as FanoutCounter.

- Min/max are now computed on the histogram and vary across samples. Count
  and sum have been pushed into Histogram.

- Added 95th percentile to reported stats.

-----
release: 9 May 2011

- Made -D option set system properties, too.

- Derived metrics (i.e. average, max, min, percentiles) are now exposed only when there are one or
  more events in a metric's histogram.

- Added admin command "stats?namespace=<name>", which will report a named StatsListener.

- Removed old hooks for adding admin HTTP path handlers. You have to use the config fields in
  AdminServiceConfig now.

- Added several GC-related counters & gauges to stats.

- Added support to the admin "server_info" command for two new build fields: current branch alias
  and the last few commit summaries (requires standard-project >= 0.12.4).

- Improved documentation significantly.


4.1.0
-----
release: 7 Apr 2011

- BackgroundProcess is no longer a Thread. It now contains a field "thread" which is the actual
  thread.
